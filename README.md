# TaskManagaer
Creating a task manager using React and Django involves building a web application that allows users to manage their tasks, including adding, updating, and completing them. React will be used for the frontend, handling the user interface and interactions, while Django will serve as the backend, managing data storage, authentication, and business logic.
